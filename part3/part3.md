# Part 3
- 1. The bug is that the values of num1 and num2 are string values, so when adding on to each other they are being concatenated together rather than their respective number values being added together. 
- 2. I would fix this by using parseInt when fetching the data by using getElementByID (Screenshot of fix in part3 folder)
